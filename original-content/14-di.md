## Dependency Injection (DI)

Throughout the project, you've seen Object references getting passed into functions as arguments, for example:

````js
app.factory('InboxFactory',
  function InboxFactory ($q, $http) {

}):
````

Here, `$q` and `$http` are injected. Without declaring them, any `$http` references would be undefined as they need to be injected to work.

With minification, Angular will break because a minifier will mangle dependency injected names, for example, this:

````js
app.factory('InboxFactory',
  function InboxFactory ($q, $http) {

}):
````

May become this when minified:

````js
app.factory('InboxFactory',
  function InboxFactory (a, b) {
  // a and b mean nothing to Angular!
}):
````

We get around this by specifying dependencies within an outer Array:

````js
app.factory('InboxFactory',
  ['$q', '$http', function InboxFactory ($q, $http) {

}]):
````

The order in which they're specified correlates to how they're passed in as arguments.

This can be a lot of painful work when working with Angular, as we have to repeat dependencies a lot. I'd highly recommend `ng-min`, a task for Grunt/Gulp which automatically adds this Array of dependencies when running the build, which takes the whole task off our hands!
