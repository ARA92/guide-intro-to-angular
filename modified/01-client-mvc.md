## Client-side MVC

Let's start with a concept which Angular have applied to their framework; client-side MVC. Broken down these things are easier to digest:

* Model: Our data, the business information of the application
* View: The HTML and presentation of data
* Controller: Connecting the pieces of our application

It's a proven approach to organizing our apps code that's been refined over many years. Angular likes to use the similar technique of MC*, where the * stands for 'whatever'.  In other words, the Controller part is different to usual, but this is beside the point, lets get something working.
