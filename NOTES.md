01 - MODELS ARE NOT SERVER COMMUNICATION ARGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!
THATS A GATEWAY. MODELS ARE BUSINESS OBJECTS

02 - do we need two way data binding explained so early?? it just comes from nowhere in the article.

03 - setup / dives straight into ng-view in example, talks about controller but doesn't explain it.

    - should explain scope
        - app scope / controller scope

    - could use an NG-VIEW / routes section

04 - changed name of this, avoiding word dependencies to keep the idea of dependencies clear for DI
