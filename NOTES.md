## App
### directives
- make a module_title directive for string templates
- move the GIANT string templates into view files
- shows both techniques

### other
- avoid the use of a global called 'app', easy to break it/ show potential inside an IIFE.
- look for a place the filter can be used to do something
- tidied up some indentation on chains for readability
- the service is pointless
- why is routeParams inside the factories??
- why are there blocking alerts??
- remove dollar sign on link functions too.

## Sections

01 - MODELS ARE NOT SERVER COMMUNICATION ARGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!
THATS A GATEWAY. MODELS ARE BUSINESS OBJECTS

02 - do we need two way data binding explained so early?? it just comes from nowhere in the article.

03 - setup / dives straight into ng-view in example, talks about controller but doesn't explain it.

    - should explain scope
        - app scope / controller scope

    - could use an NG-VIEW / routes section

04 - changed name of this, avoiding word dependencies to keep the idea of dependencies clear for DI
